    <h1>🍽️ About EatWhere</h1>
    <p>
      Welcome to <strong>EatWhere</strong> — our office lunch spot finder!
    </p>

    <p>
      After months (or even years!) of eating out near the office, we noticed a recurring problem:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      “Where to eat ah?”<br />
      “Same old places again?”<br />
      “Eh, can eat halal or vegetarian or not?”
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      We get it. Lunch should be something to look forward to — not a midday headache.
    </p>

    <h2>🥢 What is EatWhere?</h2>

      <strong>good food around your workplace</strong>, especially when you're out of ideas or have teammates with different dietary needs.
      <br />
      *(“jiak” = eat, “ho” = good, “liao” = stuff in Singlish/Hokkien)*
    </p>
